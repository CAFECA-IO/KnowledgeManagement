## How Might We exercise (HMW)

- Amp up the good
Think of how you might use any positives in the problem as a solution. 

How might we make keeping track of tickets a fun competition among friends? 

- Explore the opposite
Think of how you’d solve the opposite of the problem you’ve outlined. 

How might we create a way to lose tickets?

- Change a status quo
Think of ways to completely change the process. 

How might we make a non-paper concert ticket? 

- Break the point-of-view into pieces
This is especially helpful for long, complex problems. 

How might we keep the customer’s ticket from getting lost? How might we make a lost ticket easier for the security team to handle?

- Remove the bad
Think of how to remove the negative part of the problem entirely. 

How might we make a way for concert goers to enter a venue without needing a ticket?

- Go after the adiective
Take any negative adjectives and try to turn them into positives. 

How might we make the entry to a concert venue less stressful for ticket holders?

- Question an assumption
Remove or change any processes that you assume have to be in place. 

How might we remove the security check process at a concert?

- Create an analogy using the established need or context
Think of ways to compare this user experience to another experience.  

How might we make going through security like playing a video game?

- Identify unexpected resources that can provide assistance
Think of how the problem might be solved by a resource that isn’t mentioned in the problem statement. 

How might facial recognition software help manage concert entry?

## Crazy eight
- 8 solutions in 8 minutes (Make sure your problem is well defined)

- Start with a large sheet of paper. Fold the paper in half, then fold it in half again, then in half one more time. When you unfold the paper, you’ll have eight squares to sketch in.

- Grab something to draw with. A lot of designers prefer to draw using Sharpies, but a pencil or pen will work too. You can use whatever you already have to draw. 

- Set your timer to eight minutes. You’ll have one minute to sketch each design idea.

- Let the ideas flow. Draw any and every solution that comes to your mind. If you have more than eight ideas, feel free to repeat the exercise.
