# What is Design sprint

## Time-bound process with five phases typically spread out over five full, eight-hour days.

- 1. Understand- Map out the problem and pick an important area to focus. (Understanding)
- 2. Ideate- Sketch out competing solutions on paper. (Brainstorming)
- 3. Decide- Make decisions and turn your ideas into a testable hypothesis.
- 4. Prototype- Hack together a realistic prototype.
- 5. Test- Get feedback from real live users.

# Example

Our latest app lets cyclists track their distance ridden and calories burned. 
Sadly, the app sales have started going down. So, how can a design sprint solve this problem?


## Plan design sprint
- Step 1 - User research. To find out the user problems you're trying to solve during the sprint.
- Step 2 - Call in the experts. Helps clarify the problem your sprint is trying to solve.
- Step 3 - Find the right space and get supplies it's really important to make sure all the workers have equal chance to talk in this space and allows them to moving around. Because you will spend a lot of time there so try to make it cozy.
- Stpe 4 - Establish the rules of the sprint, this will decide what kind of vibe this design sprint will be.
- Stpe 5 - Making Design sprint brief.

## Making Design sprint brief includes
- Design sprint challenge (Cycling app: Build exciting new features for the cycling app in time for relaunch later in the year.)
- Identify the key deliverables (Cycling app:Have a complete prototype that includes the feature update.)
- Where and when the sprint will happen. Who's attending and the name of the sprint leader. 
- Add approvers (Cycling app: Needs the official approval of Luphia, CEO before launching)
- Project overview
- Sprint schedule hour by hour

## During the design sprint
- Understand - Your team takes time to learn from experts and engage in creative discussions with a lot of different people from other departments and industries. These conversations help you more clearly understand the design challenge.let's say sales are going down because the app doesn't offer anything new.
- Ideate - Start by coming up with ideas and building off of them to create solutions. Each participant takes time to sketch and present their ideas. You also need to start planning for user testing, which happens in phase five of the sprint.
- Decide - According to the ideas you have on phase 2, now you need to decide on the one solution that is most likely to excite users and increase sales. For example, the solution might be a feature that uses the cyclist's location to create customized routes that meet their fitness goals.
- Prototype - Your team creates a working prototype of the new customized routes feature. (Doesn't need to be the final product. Only enough to do the test.)
- Test - As users test your prototype, you observe how they react and then interview them about their experiences. Your team gains critical insight about changes that need to be made before you launch the new feature.

## Retrospective
The goal of a retrospective is to make sure everyone who took part in the sprint has the chance to give feedback and think about opportunities for improvement. 
- Should be done right after the design sprint
- What went well? 
- What can be improved?
