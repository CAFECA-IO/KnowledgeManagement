Today, we will be collaborating with two prominent AI platforms, ChatGPT and Midjourney, which have garnered significant recognition in the current AI landscape. Our objective is to explore how these platforms can provide valuable support to UI/UX designers in their work.

# Chat GPT

## UX research

### Define your product

1. Knowing your potential users.

```Define the target market for a [your product].```

2. Picture how your product would be looked like...

```Outline the key features and benefits of [your product].```

These prompts are helpful for designers to clearly grasp the basic concept of the product. Moreover, they can be expanded upon to delve deeper into various aspects.
With ChatGPT, you can save a significant amount of time on Googling and gathering data on your own.

### User interview 

1. Interviews

```I want to interview some [your product] users. I want to find out what makes them loyal users. Write me 10 interview questions I can ask.```

2. Survey

```I want to conduct a survey for [your product] users to know what makes them loyal users. Also try to learn what's their pain point now. Can you give me 10 survey questions that I can ask.```

In this phase, ChatGPT can provide researchers with the foundational framework for both interview and survey questions. However, as a seasoned UX researcher, it's essential to tailor and refine these questions to align precisely with our specific requirements and objectives. But it is time saving for sure.

### Competitor analysis

1. Knowing who

```Who are a [your product] 5 biggest competitors```

2. Knowing how

Continuing from the previous question
```Who are a [your product] 5 biggest competitors```
