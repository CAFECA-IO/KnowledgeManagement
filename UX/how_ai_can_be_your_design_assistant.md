Today, we will be collaborating with two prominent AI platforms, ChatGPT and Midjourney, which have garnered significant recognition in the current AI landscape. Our objective is to explore how these platforms can provide valuable support to UI/UX designers in their work.

# Chat GPT

## UX research

### Define your product

1. Knowing your potential users.

```Define the target market for a [your product].```

2. Picture how your product would be looked like...

```Outline the key features and benefits of [your product].```

These prompts are helpful for designers to clearly grasp the basic concept of the product. Moreover, they can be expanded upon to delve deeper into various aspects.
With ChatGPT, you can save a significant amount of time on Googling and gathering data on your own.

### User interview 

1. Interviews

```I want to interview some [your product] users. I want to find out what makes them loyal users. Write me 10 interview questions I can ask.```

2. Survey

```I want to conduct a survey for [your product] users to know what makes them loyal users. Also try to learn what's their pain point now. Can you give me 10 survey questions that I can ask.```

In this phase, ChatGPT can provide researchers with the foundational framework for both interview and survey questions. However, as a seasoned UX researcher, it's essential to tailor and refine these questions to align precisely with our specific requirements and objectives. But it is time saving for sure.

### Competitor analysis

1. Knowing who

```Who are a [your product] 5 biggest competitors```

<img width="795" alt="who" src="https://github.com/CAFECA-IO/KnowledgeManagement/assets/98379087/66640764-ee74-41f8-a81c-4f187414df37">

2. Knowing how

Continuing from the previous question
```Who are a [your product] 5 biggest competitors```

<img width="813" alt="how" src="https://github.com/CAFECA-IO/KnowledgeManagement/assets/98379087/008a5389-86c1-47df-b69c-e521d61006f5">


## Analysis

### Persona

```Can you build a persona for mining software user including their behavior, wants and need. in table```

<img width="790" alt="persona" src="https://github.com/CAFECA-IO/KnowledgeManagement/assets/98379087/f5d1882c-6a53-4d82-be21-eb5967fde2d5">

In here, you can also add some specific codition acoording to your previous user research to the persona, like what type of user, age, experience or so to fit your scenario better.
Sometime ChatGPT might give you some insight that you didn't notice before.

### User story

```can you give me the user story of [name from previous answer]```

<img width="795" alt="user story" src="https://github.com/CAFECA-IO/KnowledgeManagement/assets/98379087/2d2e37c8-6919-40e9-af3e-e35ff41c819a">

It would be more beneficial if you could continue the inquiry after creating the persona. Alternatively, if you have distinct personas in mind, you can inform ChatGPT in advance. This approach enables it to craft more accurate and creative content.

### User flow

```Create a user flow for [your product].```

<img width="790" alt="user flow" src="https://github.com/CAFECA-IO/KnowledgeManagement/assets/98379087/fd8ab58f-2352-417c-9ff8-1a229c760405">

Here, you can incorporate additional conditions, such as considering the devices or environments in which the user flow will be experienced. This ensures that the user flow aligns with the specific requirements of your final product.

## Wireframing

```create a wireframe in text for mining software app on desktop that's friendly and easy adaptive for new user```

<img width="790" alt="截圖 2023-08-22 下午4 16 32" src="https://github.com/CAFECA-IO/KnowledgeManagement/assets/98379087/7339fc01-1777-4741-9203-14623189629b">

Given that ChatGPT is a text-based AI, it's incapable of directly generating visual content like wireframes. However, it can provide a fundamental outline of the elements that should be present in your final wireframe. It's still our job to visualize it.
