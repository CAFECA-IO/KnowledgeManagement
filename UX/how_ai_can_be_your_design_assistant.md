Today, we will be collaborating with two prominent AI platforms, ChatGPT and Midjourney, which have garnered significant recognition in the current AI landscape. Our objective is to explore how these platforms can provide valuable support to UI/UX designers in their work.

# Chat GPT

## UX research

### Define your product

1. Knowing your potential users.

```Define the target market for a [your product].```

2. Picture how your product would be looked like...

```Outline the key features and benefits of [your product].```

<img width="789" alt="Outline the key features and benefits of" src="https://github.com/CAFECA-IO/KnowledgeManagement/assets/98379087/f4277e78-8f72-423d-8db0-81ec19966458">

These prompts are helpful for designers to clearly grasp the basic concept of the product. Moreover, they can be expanded upon to delve deeper into various aspects.
With ChatGPT, you can save a significant amount of time on Googling and gathering data on your own.

### User interview 

1. Interviews

```I want to interview some [your product] users. I want to find out what makes them loyal users. Write me 10 interview questions I can ask.```

<img width="786" alt="interview" src="https://github.com/CAFECA-IO/KnowledgeManagement/assets/98379087/46dfddad-b4ae-4dd2-90b0-4fd51bd847e3">

2. Survey

```I want to conduct a survey for [your product] users to know what makes them loyal users. Also try to learn what's their pain point now. Can you give me 10 survey questions that I can ask.```

<img width="789" alt="survey" src="https://github.com/CAFECA-IO/KnowledgeManagement/assets/98379087/34736a9d-f551-4542-bf83-49465df0f0d7">

In this phase, ChatGPT can provide researchers with the foundational framework for both interview and survey questions. However, as a seasoned UX researcher, it's essential to tailor and refine these questions to align precisely with our specific requirements and objectives. But it is time saving for sure.

### Competitor analysis

1. Knowing who

```Who are a [your product] 5 biggest competitors```

<img width="795" alt="who" src="https://github.com/CAFECA-IO/KnowledgeManagement/assets/98379087/66640764-ee74-41f8-a81c-4f187414df37">

2. Knowing how

Continuing from the previous question
```Who are a [your product] 5 biggest competitors```

<img width="813" alt="how" src="https://github.com/CAFECA-IO/KnowledgeManagement/assets/98379087/008a5389-86c1-47df-b69c-e521d61006f5">


## Analysis

### Persona

```Can you build a persona for mining software user including their behavior, wants and need. in table```

<img width="790" alt="persona" src="https://github.com/CAFECA-IO/KnowledgeManagement/assets/98379087/f5d1882c-6a53-4d82-be21-eb5967fde2d5">

In here, you can also add some specific codition acoording to your previous user research to the persona, like what type of user, age, experience or so to fit your scenario better.
Sometime ChatGPT might give you some insight that you didn't notice before.

### User story

```can you give me the user story of [name from previous answer]```

<img width="795" alt="user story" src="https://github.com/CAFECA-IO/KnowledgeManagement/assets/98379087/2d2e37c8-6919-40e9-af3e-e35ff41c819a">

It would be more beneficial if you could continue the inquiry after creating the persona. Alternatively, if you have distinct personas in mind, you can inform ChatGPT in advance. This approach enables it to craft more accurate and creative content.

### User flow

```Create a user flow for [your product].```

<img width="790" alt="user flow" src="https://github.com/CAFECA-IO/KnowledgeManagement/assets/98379087/fd8ab58f-2352-417c-9ff8-1a229c760405">

Here, you can incorporate additional conditions, such as considering the devices or environments in which the user flow will be experienced. This ensures that the user flow aligns with the specific requirements of your final product.

## Wireframing

```create a wireframe in text for mining software app on desktop that's friendly and easy adaptive for new user```

<img width="790" alt="截圖 2023-08-22 下午4 16 32" src="https://github.com/CAFECA-IO/KnowledgeManagement/assets/98379087/7339fc01-1777-4741-9203-14623189629b">

Given that ChatGPT is a text-based AI, it's incapable of directly generating visual content like wireframes. However, it can provide a fundamental outline of the elements that should be present in your final wireframe. It's still our job to visualize it.

## UX Writting

This is my personal favorite part.
Ask ChatGPT for UX writting ideas, in any languages you want!

1. Page description

```Give me 10 interesting and creative captions for 404 page```
<img width="813" alt="404" src="https://github.com/CAFECA-IO/KnowledgeManagement/assets/98379087/4c70b05e-e486-40b0-91ea-e9b359b7e6cd">

2. Buttons

```Give me 10 idea for the caption of CTA buttons```
<img width="821" alt="CTA" src="https://github.com/CAFECA-IO/KnowledgeManagement/assets/98379087/6269d2fb-2e82-4941-ae1c-93b030cc7a41">


3. Headline or Content

```Give me 10 Professional headline for a blockchain solution company's web```
<img width="821" alt="headline" src="https://github.com/CAFECA-IO/KnowledgeManagement/assets/98379087/5253dfa5-46c5-449b-aff0-21b32b51d8a9">


## UI Design

### Checklist for UI Design

```Create a checklist for UI elements for a perfect mining software in a table```

<img width="826" alt="checklist" src="https://github.com/CAFECA-IO/KnowledgeManagement/assets/98379087/aff566e1-8382-45b2-88d2-e95231d14451">

This table can serve as a foundation for ensuring that your product's user interface covers the essential elements for a seamless user experience.
You can adapt and expand the checklist based on your specific functionalities and requirements. 


### Color palettes

It's really fast to generate color palettes with ChatGPT, you can just tell it your brand color and the elements you need then everything will be done in few second.

```Can you give me a bright and energetic color palette for a mining software app in bright mode with the brand color #FFA502 and #1A2E50. Including background, surface, text, button in default, hover and disable state, state color. List them in table```

<img width="817" alt="color" src="https://github.com/CAFECA-IO/KnowledgeManagement/assets/98379087/1f358d67-bff7-4655-ad05-ac7d4fd329dc">

As a professional UX designer, we know how important accessibility is. So don; don't forget to check the color you are going to use is complied with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.
Here is what you can do.

```Can you check if this color palette comply with Level AAA```

<img width="792" alt="AAA" src="https://github.com/CAFECA-IO/KnowledgeManagement/assets/98379087/903e611c-84ea-41b4-a041-8d46ecc1fdad">

```can you fix that problem and give me a new color palette ```

<img width="793" alt="fix" src="https://github.com/CAFECA-IO/KnowledgeManagement/assets/98379087/75835bfa-0d31-4bef-8613-e6f00b075d87">

Here you go, A color palette with your brand voice and user-friendly is done. And you can always make little change to ensure the color palette fits your needs.


### Generate svg code (Beta)

As we know ChatGPT is an AI text-based model, so it can't generate SVG images directly. However, it can help you generate SVG code for a simple icon.
Let's see how it work.

```can you generate an email outline icon in svg code```

<img width="801" alt="icon" src="https://github.com/CAFECA-IO/KnowledgeManagement/assets/98379087/7e9837ab-9e70-4c14-8c4d-5471ee341f14">


Result:

<img width="116" alt="截圖 2023-08-23 上午11 24 34" src="https://github.com/CAFECA-IO/KnowledgeManagement/assets/98379087/6b3d8438-3e7b-485e-b248-895663727612">

Looks OK right? Let's try something more complicated...

```can you generate a cute cat outline icon in svg code```

<img width="822" alt="截圖 2023-08-23 上午11 29 37" src="https://github.com/CAFECA-IO/KnowledgeManagement/assets/98379087/4c7d453d-8f02-4e0d-993b-e10b66527427">

Result:

<img width="131" alt="截圖 2023-08-23 上午11 26 30" src="https://github.com/CAFECA-IO/KnowledgeManagement/assets/98379087/a9753b86-c7d2-436e-94e0-9a03c7c21a99">


Now we know ChatGPT doesn't have any sense of art or even doesn't know what a cat should be look like.
But hope one day it will learn then it can be pretty helphul.
